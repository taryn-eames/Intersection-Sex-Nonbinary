_Abstract:_ This study examines the intersection of sex and nonbinary gender identity in hiring discrimination using a resume audit study, where sex was signaled via first name and nonbinary identity via “they/them” pronoun disclosure. Results show male and female nonbinary applicants face similar discrimination levels, with patterns in sex-based discrimination resembling those of cisgender applicants with the same implied sex: female-named applicants are penalized in male-dominated occupations and vice versa. Applicants with intersecting minoritized identities—being both the non-dominant sex and disclosing nonbinary pronouns—face heightened discrimination. These findings highlight the importance of considering intersecting identities in understanding labor market disparities.
