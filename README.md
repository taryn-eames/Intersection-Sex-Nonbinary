# Intersectionality in hiring discrimination: The case of sex and nonbinary gender identities in a range of low skill occupations

_Abstract:_ Existing research consistently shows that while females are discriminated against in male-dominated occupations and jobs that emphasize stereotypically “masculine” attributes, the opposite is true for males. Are patterns in discrimination different for nonbinary applicants with male- or female-sounding names? I find that in the context of low-skill occupations with varying sex compositions, nonbinary applicants face discrimination patterns resembling those of cisgender applicants with the same name-implied sex. In addition, discrimination appears to be additive: applicants who are both the non-dominant sex and disclose ``they/them" pronouns are doubly penalized.
